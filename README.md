# Deep_Learning

This repository contains code and slides to help understand neural networks (simple, convolutional and recurrent). 

Using Chapter 10 - Deep Learning in the Introduction to Statistical Learning book as a starting point, the code and slides here provide an introductory summary to neural networks.

The code uses the MNIST database to test a multi-layer artificial neural network with different learning rates and activation functions.

The slides provide the maths behind the propogation (front and back) algorithms used to train an artificial neural network.
